I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me I'll never tell
I looked at you as it fell
And now you're in my way
000-000-0000
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way
11111
Your stare was holding

Ripped jeans
Skin was showing
Hot night
Wind was blowing
000-000-0000
Where you think you're going baby?
Hey I just met you
And this is crazy
But here's my number
22222
So call me maybe

It's hard to look right at you baby
But here's my number
So call me maybe
The End

No more, please!
I can't take this any more
This song is so bad
Arrrrrrggghhhh
33333
Sadness.
